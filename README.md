DesignPattern
=============

The project DesignPattern contains practices of java design pattern.
This is my own understanding of the book <<Head first design patterns>>

The project does not contain all patterns but the common ones.
The code sample is simple ,the project does not dependence on any third party jars, you can import it directly to your Ecliplse/MyEclipse
