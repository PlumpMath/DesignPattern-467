DesignPattern
=============

The project DesignPattern contains practices of java design pattern.
This is my own understanding of the book \<\<Head first design patterns\>\>

The project does not contain all patterns but the common ones.
The samples are simple and brief, they do not dependence on any third libraries.

You can import it directly to your Ecliplse/MyEclipse
